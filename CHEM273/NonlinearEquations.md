# Solving Nonlinear Equations

1. The problem
* We know how to solve a set of linear equations:
* root finding: finding the zeros of a polynominal
  - factored form
  - a polynomial of Nth order has N roots (real & comoplex)
  - for N >= 5: no analytical solutions
  - for N is odd: at least one real zero
 
2. Newton's method:


3. Bisection
* assumption: root is within interval[X_left, X_right]
