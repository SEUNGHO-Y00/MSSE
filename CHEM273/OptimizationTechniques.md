# Optimization Techniques

1. Lagrangian Multiplier

* problem: often we need to find an extreme of a function:
  - equilibrium at minimum energy
  - distributions for maximum entropy
  - regression: minimizing 𝜒𝑟𝑒𝑑^2 or MSE
  - classification: minimizing cross-entropy etc

2. Gradient Descent Again
  - Vanilla
  - Learning Rate Schedule
  - Momentum
  - L1 and L2
  - More Finetuning
