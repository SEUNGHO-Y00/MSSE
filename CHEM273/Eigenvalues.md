# Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

1. A geometrical approach

* About quadratic forms
  - distance to a reference point is constant
  - turning the coordinate system
    - non-diagonal elements: turnn/shear the object
    - diagonal elements: stretches (or flips, if negative) the object
  - not turned/sheared
    - principal axes of the object are parallel to the coordinate axes

2. Finding Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues

* turned ellipse
* turning the coordinate system, such that principal axes of the are parallel to the coordinate
* characteristic polynomial = N eigenvalues and N eigenvector for N coordinates

3. PCA

* Goals
  - Dimension reduction!
  - Reducing the complexity of the dataset without loosing information
  - Removing redundancies
  - Reducing the number of features
  → trick: using correlation between different features

* correlation means:
  - features are not mutually independent
  - we can predict feature a from feature b to some extend
  - we don’t need all features
  → reducing number of features (dimensions) without losing information
