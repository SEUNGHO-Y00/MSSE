# Numerical Differentiation and Integration

1. Finite Differences
* finite differences
  - (delta)x
  - (delta)f = f(x_0 + (delta)x) - f(x_0)
  - Project I (Module 9): modelling fur and skin pattern
 
* Model diffusion processes
  - heat conduction, diffusion reaction, electromagnetism etc
  - Fick's 2nd law (Concentration, diffusion constant, Laplace operator, state (e.g. location), hopping rate(probability per time))
  - Master Equation
  - 2nd derivative at x = x_0

2. Numerical Integration
* trapezoidal rule
* Newton-Cotes Equations
  - trapeoidal
  - Simpson
  - Simpson 3//8
  - Boole
  - integrating sin(x) = run the function IntegrationAccuracy.py
