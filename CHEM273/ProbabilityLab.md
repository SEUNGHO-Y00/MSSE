1. Bisection Method
* a root finding method
  - Choose the initial interval
  - compute the midpoint
  - evaluate f(x_center)
  - replace either x_right or x_left with x_center
  - Repeat

2. Example
* f(x_left) and f(x_right) must always have different signs.
* if f(x_center) * f(x_left) < 0 => set x_right to x_center
* if f(x_center) * f(x_left) > 0 => set x_left to cx_enter

3. Probability Review - Bayes Theorem
* P(A) = The probability of A occuring
* P(B) = The probability of B occuring
* P(A|B) = The probability of A given B
* P(B|A) = The probability of B given A
