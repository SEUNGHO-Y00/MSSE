# Data Fitting and Regression

1. Linear Regression

* The Math
  - a parameter y depends on many regressors x_n

* What is Linear?
  - As long as we can recover the linear structure by any transformation → it is linear

* Stats
  - fitting: finding the best β in terms of minimizing the errors

* A Python Example
  1) loading data
  2) plotting data
  3) scaling data
  4) fitting model
  5) evaluating model

2. Logistic Regression

* response is categorical

3. Curve Fitting

* problem: set of data points 𝑦𝑖 = 𝑓(𝑥𝑖 ), ideally each data point 𝑦𝑖 has an error 𝜎𝑖 we know 𝑓(𝑥𝑖 )
* goal: find parameters of 𝑓(𝑥𝑖 ) once we know the parameters → prediction
