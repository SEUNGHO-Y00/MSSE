# Vector Calculus

1. Recap: Calculus
* derivatives
  - Cusp / Corner
  - Discontinuous
  - Vertical Tangent
  - Taylor Series

    - [Taylor Series Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE0QTkGmIHo&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown%ED%95%9C%EA%B5%AD%EC%96%B4)
  - integrals
* Regression methods = statistical techniques used to model and analyze the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

2. Gradient
* A vector field that points in the direction of the steepest increase of the function at any given point and has a magnitude equal to the rate of increase in that direction
* Turns a scalar into a vector grad
* grad(y)x => gradient of y wrt x
* The gradient of a function f is a vector, because the derivatives have a direction!
* unit vector e1, e2, and e3
* grad(y)x is perpendicular to y = const

3. Line Integrals
* A line integral measures the accumulation of a function along a curve
* We will be integrating over a path
  - If the path is closed (start and endpoint are identical)
  - We can integrate over a scalar function/field or over a vector field
  - integrating the scalar function f(x,y) over the path s

4. Divergence
* The divergence of a vector field measures how much the field is expanding or contracting at a given point
* Dot product with a vector returns a scalar

5. curl
* A vector operator that describes the infinitesimal circulation of a vector field in three-dimensional space
* curls
* Cross product of two vectors returns a vector
