# Vector Calculus

1. Recap: Calculus

  - integrals

2. Gradient
* A vector field that points in the direction of the steepest increase of the function at any given point and has a magnitude equal to the rate of increase in that direction
* Turns a scalar into a vector grad

3. Line Integrals
* A line integral measures the accumulation of a function along a curve

4. Divergence
* The divergence of a vector field measures how much the field is expanding or contracting at a given point
* Dot product with a vector returns a scalar

5. curl
* A vector operator that describes the infinitesimal circulation of a vector field in three-dimensional space
* curls
* Cross product of two vectors returns a vector
