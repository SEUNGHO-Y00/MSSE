# Data Fitting and Regression Lab

* Methods
  - function is defined in a separate cell
  - function is defined once, but input variables are changed

* Array vs Lists
  - Appending to lists is slower and less memory efficient than indexing into arrays
  - vectorized operations save time
  - Please use arrays!
