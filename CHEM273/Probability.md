# Probability Theory Basics

1. Axioms of Probability
* Heuristic explanation => more mathematical rigorous: see Cox's theorem
  - [Skat Thuringia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skat_(card_game))
  - Probability P that we observe an event e_i, given, it occurred
  - P(observe|e_i)
  - If events are mutually exclusive: 3rd axiom
  - Be careful if events are not mutually exclusive (like a set of events or a sequence of events)

2. Conditional Probabilities and Bayes Theorem
* Bayes Theorem
* Marginalization

  - Statement 1: Sensitivity
  - Statement 2: prior
  - Statement 3: p-value or false positive rate

3. Information and Entropy
