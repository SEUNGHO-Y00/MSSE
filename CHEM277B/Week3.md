# Dimensionality Reduction: Principal Component Analysis

## Variance and Covariance

* the mean - The arithmetic average of a dataset

* the variance - The average of the squared differences from the mean. Variance is the covariance of a variable with itself.

* covariance - Measures the joint variability of two variables

* covariance matrix - a square matrix that describes the relationships between multiple variables in a dataset

## Correlation

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

* Dimension of PCA

* about quadratic forms
  - non-diagonal elements
  - diagonal elements
  - not turned/sheared
