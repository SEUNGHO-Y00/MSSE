# 3. Recursion & Fundamental Data Structures

## 3.1 Linear Data Structures

* Stacks and queues

* Client, implementation, interface
  - Separate interface and implementation
  - Abstract data types (ADTs)
  - Benefits
 
* Stack:linked-list representation

* Stack operations: linked-list implementation

* Stack: array considerations

* Stack: resizing-array implementation

* Shrink: amortized analysis

* SMILES validator

* Stack: iterative solution

* Queue: linked-list representation

* Queue operations: linked-list implementation

* Queue: resizing-array implementation

* Deque: best of both worlds

* Stack applications

* Arithmetic expression evaluation

* Dijkstra's two-stack algorithm

* Application: Function calls

## 3.2 Recursion

* Recursive program

* Prove recursive programs correct via induction

* Revisiting greatest common divisor (GCD)

* Stack: recursive solution

* Pitfall: infinite recursive loops

* Relevant xkcd

* Recursion tree

* Memoization

* Dequeue: iterative solution

## 3.3 Mergesort

* The sorting problem

* Insertion sort

* Insertion sort performance

* Mergesort

* Sorting COmplexity & Stability
