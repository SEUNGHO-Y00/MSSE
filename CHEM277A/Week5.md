# Introduction to SQL

## Sampling

* Why is sampling useful?
* .sample() in pandas randomly selects rows from a DataFrame
* replace parameter: whether to sample with replacement
  - bootstrapping
* Many students included this line
* random_state parameter: can get the same rows every time you run the code

## Performance

* to limit the use of loops? Loops are slow

## Fuzzy Match vs Regex

* Fuzzy Matching
  - Data contains typos
  - words are misspelled
  - Structure is mostly correct
  - possible variation
 
* Regex
  - Pattern structure
  - predictable rules
